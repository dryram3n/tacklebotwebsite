4. Compliance Requirements
You agree to use the Bot in compliance with all applicable terms and policies:

4.1 Discord Terms of Service & Community Guidelines
You must adhere to Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times while interacting with the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions against harassment, hate speech, spam, and the distribution of harmful or illegal content.

4.2 Third-Party Service Terms
When using features that rely on the third-party services listed in Section 3, you must also comply with their respective terms and policies (e.g., Google AI, Popcat, Noodles, Top.gg). This includes restrictions on generating harmful content, overloading services, and respecting intellectual property.

5. User Conduct
When using TackleBot, you agree **not** to:

*   Engage in harassment, abuse, threats, or any form of harmful behavior towards other users or the developers.
*   Use the Bot to distribute spam, unauthorized advertising, illegal materials, or content that infringes on intellectual property rights.
*   Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Bot's systems, data, or source code (beyond what is permitted by any applicable open-source license).
*   Interfere with, disrupt, or impair the normal operation, stability, or security of the Bot.
*   Misuse moderation commands (`/kick`, `/ban`, `/clear`, `/moderator`, `/log`, `/fishwhitelist`) or channel management features (`/createchannel`, `/deletechannel`).
*   Attempt to exploit, automate (botting), or manipulate the fishing game (`/fish`), gambling (`/fish gamble`), achievement system, fishing company system, leaderboard rewards, or any other game feature.
*   Attempt to circumvent or interfere with the anti-bot verification system. Providing false responses during verification is prohibited.
*   Submit false, misleading, or malicious information through the bug reporting system (`/bug`).

Violation of these conduct rules may result in temporary or permanent restrictions from using the Bot, reporting to Discord, or other actions deemed necessary by the development team or server administrators.

6. Data Usage and Privacy
The Bot collects and processes data necessary to function and provide its features. This includes User IDs, Server IDs, game progress (fishing, achievements, companies, voting, challenges), configuration settings (moderation lists, whitelists, logging), and temporarily processes content for specific commands like `/summary` and `/fun`.

Your privacy is important to us. By using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described in our **Privacy Policy**. Please review it carefully for detailed information on what data we collect, how it's used, how long it's stored, your rights, and our use of third-party services.

7. Feature-Specific Terms

7.1 Fishing Game & Anti-Bot System
*   The fishing game (`/fish` command and its subcommands) involves collecting virtual fish, managing an inventory, purchasing upgrades, participating in challenges, earning achievements, and potentially managing a fishing company.
*   All game progress is tied to your Discord User ID.
*   The game includes an anti-bot system to ensure fair play. You may be periodically required to complete verification steps. Failure to verify or attempts to automate gameplay may lead to fishing restrictions or penalties, including temporary cooldowns. Whitelisted users may be exempt from some checks but are still expected to adhere to fair play rules.

7.2 Channel Creation and Management (`/createchannel`, `/deletechannel`)
*   Users with appropriate permissions can create text or voice channels via the Bot.
*   The channel creator can grant access to specific members.
*   Server administrators and moderators retain the right to manage, modify, or delete any channels created via the Bot.
*   Channel creators are responsible for ensuring the content within their created channels complies with Discord's Terms and the server's rules.

7.3 Moderation Features (`/kick`, `/ban`, `/clear`, `/moderator`, `/log`, `/fishwhitelist`)
*   These commands are intended for use by server administrators and designated moderators (managed via `/moderator`).
*   Misuse of these commands is prohibited. Actions taken using these commands should comply with Discord's Terms and server rules.
*   The `/log` feature, if enabled, sends server event data to a channel within that Discord server. The Bot does not store these logs long-term itself.

7.4 Chat Summarization (`/summary`)
*   This feature uses Google Generative AI (Gemini) to process recent public messages in a channel *upon explicit user request*.
*   The Bot does not store the message content used for summaries.
*   Use of this feature must comply with Google's AI terms (see Section 4.2).

7.5 Voting (`/vote`) & Top.gg Integration
*   Voting for the Bot on Top.gg is optional but appreciated.
*   Voting rewards (e.g., Voter Chests) are granted based on successful vote validation via the Top.gg webhook.
*   You may receive DM reminders to vote; these can be disabled via buttons provided in the DM or vote command response.

8. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Bot is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, accuracy, or non-infringement. The developers do not guarantee that the Bot will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet your specific requirements.

9. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall Thromblo or the TackleBot development team be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

*   Any conduct or content of any third party on the service.
*   Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.
*   Any errors, bugs, or inaccuracies in the Bot's operation.

10. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of significant changes, typically via the `/announce` command or by updating the "Last updated" date below. Your continued use of the Bot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

11. Termination
We may terminate or suspend your access to the Bot immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Server administrators may also remove the Bot from their server at any time.
