        <h2>7. Feature-Specific Terms</h2>

        <h2>11. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Bot immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including breaches of these Terms. Server administrators may remove the Bot from their servers at any time.</p>
