Created by Thromblo

Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how TackleBot Discord Bot ("the Bot", "we", "us", "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects user data when you interact with our service. By using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

Last Updated: June 9, 2025

Data Collection
Information We Collect
The Bot collects and processes the following data to provide its services:

1.  **User Information:**
    *   Discord User IDs: For identifying users for game features, settings, moderation, channel creation, voting, whitelisting, bug reports, and command interactions.
    *   Discord Server (Guild) IDs: For server-specific settings, moderation features, channel creation, logging configuration, and command interactions.
    *   Command Interaction History: Basic information about which commands are used by which users and in which servers for functionality and improvement purposes.

2.  **Game and Feature Data:**
    *   Fishing Game Data: Player statistics (level, XP, total catches, earnings, rarity counts, biggest fish, etc.), fish inventory, upgrade levels (luck, speed, multicatch, inventory, value, explorer), research progress, challenge progress, preferred fishing locations, fishing company data (boats, upgrades, earnings). Stored persistently associated with your User ID.
    *   Gamble Data: Gambling statistics (e.g., consecutive wins/losses). Stored persistently with your User ID.
    *   Achievement Data: Progress and completion status for in-game achievements. Stored persistently with your User ID.

3.  **Content Data (Processed, Mostly Not Stored Long-Term by the Bot):**
    *   `/summary` Command: Content of recent public messages in the channel where the command is used. This content is sent to Google Generative AI (Gemini) for processing to generate the summary but is *not* permanently stored by the Bot.
    *   `/fun` Commands (Text Input): Text provided by users for commands like `achievement`, `changemymind`, `awkwardmonkey`, `burnpaper`, `drake`, `sadcat`, `oogway`, `biden`, `pikachu`, `mock`, `lulcat`, `opinion`, `imdb`, `8ball`. This text is sent to the relevant third-party API (Popcat or Noodles Wrapper) for processing to generate the output image or text. It is *not* permanently stored by the Bot.
    *   `/fun` Commands (Image Input): Images (uploaded or via URL) provided by users for commands like `blur`, `wide`, `uglyupclose`, `communist`, `whowouldwin`, `ship`, `opinion`. This image data is sent to the relevant third-party API (Popcat or Noodles Wrapper) for processing. It is *not* permanently stored by the Bot.
    *   `/announce` Command: Announcement message content (temporary, not stored).

4.  **Vote Data (via Top.gg):**
    *   When you vote on Top.gg, we receive your Discord User ID via a webhook.
    *   We store your User ID, the timestamp of your last vote, your current vote streak, and your preference for vote reminders. Stored persistently until data deletion is requested.

How We Use Your Data
Your data is used solely to:

*   Provide Core Bot Functionality: Execute commands, respond to interactions.
*   Manage Game Systems: Store and retrieve fishing progress, inventory, upgrades, currency, challenges, achievements, and company data. Enable gambling features.
*   Generate Summaries: Process recent chat messages via Google Gemini for the `/summary` command upon user request.
*   Generate Fun Content: Process user-provided text and images via Popcat and Noodles APIs for `/fun` commands.
*   Track Voting: Record Top.gg votes, calculate streaks, award Voter Chests, and send DM reminders (if enabled).
*   Manage Bug Reports: Store, display, and manage bug reports submitted via `/bug report`.
*   Calculate Leaderboards: Determine weekly leaderboard winners based on fishing stats and distribute rewards.
*   Improve Bot Functionality: Analyze aggregated, anonymized command usage data to identify popular features or areas for improvement.

Data Storage and Security
Duration of Storage
*   Game Data (Fishing, Gamble, Achievements, Company): Stored indefinitely until explicitly cleared by the user via commands or data deletion request.
*   Vote Data (Last Vote, Streak, Reminder Pref): Stored indefinitely until data deletion is requested.
*   Bug Report Data: Stored until the report is resolved or closed by the user or development team.
*   Summary & Fun Command Content: Processed temporarily by third-party APIs; not stored permanently by the Bot.

Backup System
*   The Bot maintains automated backups of persistent user data (like fishing data, stats, vote data, company data).
*   Backups are created regularly (e.g., approximately every 30 minutes).
*   A limited number of recent backups (e.g., the last 3) are retained for disaster recovery purposes.

Data Security
We implement reasonable technical and administrative security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no online service can be 100% secure.

Third-Party Services
The Bot utilizes several third-party services that may process your data:

1.  **Discord API:** Used for all Bot interactions within Discord. Subject to Discord's Privacy Policy.
2.  **Google Generative AI (Gemini):**
    *   Model: `gemini-2.0-flash`.
    *   Used *solely* for the `/summary` command functionality. Processes recent public message content from the specified channel to generate summaries.
    *   Subject to Google's AI Principles and Privacy Policy.
3.  **Popcat API:**
    *   Used for various `/fun` subcommands (e.g., `fact`, `joke`, `imdb`, `sadcat`, `oogway`, `communist`, `whowouldwin`, `lulcat`, `opinion`, `ship`, `biden`, `pikachu`, `mock`, `8ball`).
    *   May process user-provided text or images/URLs to generate responses.
    *   Subject to Popcat API's data handling practices.
4.  **Noodles Wrapper (French Noodles API):**
    *   Used for various `/fun` subcommands (e.g., `meme`, `achievement`, `changemymind`, `awkwardmonkey`, `blur`, `burnpaper`, `drake`, `wide`, `uglyupclose`).
    *   May process user-provided text or images/URLs for feature functionality.
    *   Subject to the API provider's data handling practices.
5.  **Top.gg API & Webhooks:**

    *   Subject to Top.gg's Privacy Policy.

Your Rights
You have the right to:

*   Request access to your stored game data (e.g., using `/fish stats`).
*   Request deletion of your game data (contact the development team or use relevant future commands).
*   Disable vote reminders via the button in the reminder DM or vote command message.
*   Opt out of data collection by removing the Bot from your server or discontinuing its use.
*   Contact us with questions or concerns about your data.

Data Deletion
*   Game data (fishing stats, inventory, upgrades, achievements, company data) can be deleted upon request to the development team. Specific commands for data reset may be available.
*   Server administrators can remove users from the moderator list (`/moderator remove`) or fishing whitelist (`/fishwhitelist remove`).
*   Users who created channels via `/createchannel` can delete them using `/deletechannel` (subject to permissions). Admins/Mods may also delete these channels. Channel creator data is also subject to automated cleanup.
*   Vote reminder preferences can be changed using the provided buttons. Full vote history deletion requires contacting the development team.
*   Server administrators can disable logging (`/log disable`) which stops future event logging and removes the stored log channel configuration.

AI in Development and Service Enhancement
To aid in the development, maintenance, and improvement of TackleBot, we leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools and models from various providers, which may include Google (e.g., Gemini models) and Anthropic. These technologies are primarily used for:
*   **Software Development:** Assisting with code generation, analysis, and optimization for the Bot's codebase.
*   **Operational Support:** Helping to create documentation, identify areas for service improvement, or generate non-user-specific content.

The use of AI for these internal purposes is aimed at enhancing the quality and efficiency of the Bot. Any AI-powered features that directly process user data, such as the `/summary` command's use of Google Gemini, are explicitly detailed within the 'Data Collection' and 'Third-Party Services' sections of this policy.


Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this policy, and potentially through in-Bot announcements (`/announce`).

Contact Information

Legal Basis for Processing
We process your data based on:

*   **Consent:** Provided when you add the Bot to your server or use commands that explicitly state data processing (like `/summary`).
*   **Legitimate Interest:** Necessary for providing the Bot's core functionality, game features, moderation tools, anti-abuse systems, and improving the service.
*   **Performance of a Contract (Implicit):** Processing data is necessary to provide the service (the Bot's features) you request by interacting with it.

By using TackleBot, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.
